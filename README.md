## DESCRIPTION

Machine learning (ML) is a new branch of computer science that provides services for automatic translation and speech recognition (Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant), product recommendations (Netflix, Amazon, etc.), transportation (Waymo, Tesla, the City of Copenhagen), and political campaigns (Facebook and Cambridge Analytica). ML is becoming a familiar presence in our lives; computer scientists and developers introduce new applications every day for chatting with humans, recommending the best course of action, and making predictions about the future. In spite of all the press, ML remains daunting to non-specialists. This class seeks to mend this divide. This class will introduce ML concepts to students without prior experience and provide templates to get students working in ML right away.

We will study and remake artworks by Mario Klingemann, Anna Ridler, Sougwen Chung, Memo Akten, Helena Sarin, Tom White, and others. We will try several techniques and frameworks such as image segm	entation, CycleGAN, pix2pix, and Tensorflow. Students will propose and work on a larger project in the last third of the class.

Prerequisite: Any experience with programming, especially with p5.js, ml5.js, and Python.

## QUESTIONS

-   What is machine intelligence and artificial intelligence?

## Course and Institutional Policies

#### **COVID-19 Policies**:

Please wear your masks during class. Please consult https://www.scrippscollege.edu/scripps-strong/return-to-campus-plan/ for the latest information. 

#### Attendance Policy:

You may miss up to four classes and still pass this class. Note that 60 percent of the students' grade is given for work on in-class activities, and that these cannot be repeated except in extraordinary circumstances. 

#### Participation Policy:

You are expected to be attentive, ask questions, work alone and with a partner to complete your work. 

#### Late Assignment and Missed Exam Policy:

Labs and in-class activities will not be repeated except in extraordinary circumstances. 

#### Academic Integrity:

 Students are expected to abide by the Scripps College academic integrity code. You must submit work that is your own and which is original work for this class. Also, all sources must be documented. Omission of sources is considered plagiarism, even if it is an oversight and/or unintentional. All plagiarism will be reported to the department and Dean’s office for further action. For this course, collaboration is allowed in on lab activities and assignments IFF all contributions are documented. 

Permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in any form (e.g. email, Word doc, Box file, Google sheet, or a hard copy). Also, assignments that have been previously submitted in another course may not be submitted for this course, and I discourage you from finding solutions on Stack Overflow or other online forums to paste into your notebooks.

#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:

 Scripps students seeking to register to receive academic accommodations must contact Academic Resources and Services Staff (ARS) at ars@scrippscollege.edu to formalize accommodations. Students will be required to submit documentation and meet with a staff member before being approved for accommodations. Once ARS has authorized academic accommodations, a formal notification will be sent out.

A student’s home campus is responsible for establishing and providing accommodations. If you are not a Scripps student, you must contact your home institution to establish accommodations. Below is a list of coordinators on the other campuses:

CMC - Julia Easley, julia.easley@claremontmckenna.edu

Harvey Mudd – Deborah Kahn, dkahn@hmc.edu

Pitzer- Gabriella Tempestoso, gabriella_tempestoso@pitzer.edu

Pomona - Jan Collins-Eaglin, Jan.Collins-Eaglin@pomona.edu

 

#### Inclusivity Statement:

 This class is an example of Scripps College’s commitment to changing the norms in Computer Science. Creating this initiative at a liberal arts women's college is both a bold step towards correcting gender imbalance in this field. 

Our community represents a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives. We are committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity.   



#### Institutional Policies:

 Students are responsible for reviewing Scripps College’s policies on incomplete grades, sexual misconduct, adverse weather, as well as student evaluation of instruction, and days of special concern/religious holiday.

Watch Dan Shiffman's videos before class on Wednesday.

1. [Teachable Machine 1: Image Classification](https://youtu.be/kwcillcWOg0)
1. [Teachable Machine 2: Snake Game](https://youtu.be/UPgxnGC8oBU)



We will start by using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com), "a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone." This experiment from Google to bring a no-code and low-code approach to training AI models.

This teaching tool from Google demonstrates a machine learning workflow that you will use throughout the course:

1. [Gather images, sound, etc.](https://youtu.be/DFBbSTvtpy4)
2. [Train the model](https://youtu.be/CO67EQ0ZWgA)
3. Preview and Save/Export

It may be designed for High School STEM programs, but that doesn't mean that you can't make something interesting with Teachable Machine. Let's try it!



### Exercises

**Exercise 1.** Train teachable machine to learn the difference between red and green. Export your model for later.

**Exercise 2.** Train Teachable Machine to recognize your voices. Make a different class for each person--we can use the model to identify who is speaking. Save/Export your model to use in. **p5.js.**

**Exercise 3.** Let's do something interesting with your voice classifier. Watch this video showing a [collective game of PONG.](https://vimeo.com/78043173) Could you play PONG with your classifiers? Amy Goodchild [reproduced the experiment](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/collaborative-control-using-paddles) in 2018.

(Note that Carpenter returned to SIGGRAPH with an. airplane simulation. Could you fly an airplane collectively?)

Dan Shiffman's [video on using Teachable Machine](https://youtu.be/kwcillcWOg0) will help you with the next step (whatever that might be!). Let's try making a game!



### ML in the browser with ml5.js

Leverage your knowledge (and models) to make new projects and games.

by using a browser-based machine learning library called [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org). ml5.js provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with no other external dependencies.

The library is supported by code examples, tutorials, and sample datasets with an emphasis on ethical computing. Bias in data, stereotypical harms, and responsible crowdsourcing are part of the documentation around data collection and usage. We're building friendly machine learning for the web - we're glad you're here!

ml5.js is heavily inspired by Processing and p5.js.

## CODE OF CONDUCT

Please read and review the [ITP/IMA Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/blob/main/README.md). The Code of Conduct will be reviewed and discussed as part of the course introduction.

The ITP/IMA Code of Conduct is an evolving work-in-progress document that establishes and communicates the commitment of the ITP/IMA community to uphold a key set of standards and obligations that aim to make ITP/IMA an inclusive and welcoming environment.

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

An introductory course designed to provide students with hands-on experience developing creative coding projects with machine learning. The history, theory, and application of machine learning algorithms and related datasets are explored in a laboratory context of experimentation and discussion. Examples and exercises will be demonstrated in JavaScript using the p5.js, ml5.js, and TensorFlow.js libraries. In addition, students will learn to work with open source pre-trained models in the cloud using Runway. Principles of data collection and ethics are introduced. Weekly assignments, team and independent projects, and project reports are required.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

At the completion of this course, the student will:

- Develop an intuition for and high level understanding of core machine learning concepts and algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, classification, and regression.
- Be able to apply machine learning algorithms to real-time interaction in media art projects using pre-trained models and “transfer learning” in JavaScript and related tools.
- Learn how to collect a custom dataset to train a machine learning model and
- Develop a vocabulary for critical discussions around the social impact and ethics of data collection and application of machine learning algorithms.
- Become familiar with the current landscape of new media art generated from machine learning algorithms. Understand how to use a machine learning model to generate media: words, sound, and images.

## EQUIPMENT

You will need a modern laptop (4 years old or younger is a good rule of thumb). Most required software is freely available. The department has all required commercial software installed on laptops available for checkout.

## COURSE TEXTS

There is no textbook for the class. Readings and videos will be assigned on the individual session notes pages.

## GRADING AND ATTENDANCE

Grades for the course will follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown:

- 25% Participation
- 50% Assignments (including reading responses and other written work)
- 25% Final project

At most two (2) unexcused absences will be tolerated without effect to your grade. Any more than two (2) unexcused absences will result a lowering of your final grade by one whole grade for each unexcused absence. For example, three (3) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A. Four (4) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a C and so on. Six (6) unexcused absences would result in an automatic F for the course. Two (2) late arrivals will count for one (1) absence.

## PARTICIPATION:

This class will be highly participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions, engage in group work, give feedback to your peers, and otherwise fully participate in class.



## TEACHING STYLE



## COURSE SCHEDULE

The course will be two (2) times per week for one hour and thirty minutes (1:30) for a total of 14 weeks.

## ASSIGNMENTS

There will be regular assignments that are relevant the class material. These assignments must be documented (written description, photos, screenshots, screen recording, code, and video all qualify based on the assignment) on a web platform such as a blog or google doc. You are required to link to your assignment from the course repo (you may choose to use a privately shared google doc or password protected website if you prefer.) The due dates are specified on the assignment page.

It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. If significant portions are simply not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If it is more than a week late, not turned in, or an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

Responses to reading and other written assignments are also due in class one week after they are assigned and must also be submitted via the class website. Written assignments are expected to be 200 to 500 words in length unless otherwise specified. Grading will follow the same guidelines as above; on time and meeting the criteria specified will be marked as complete. Late (up to 1 week) or partially completed work will be given half credit. Work that is more than a week late, not turned in, or fails to meet the criteria specified will be given no credit.
